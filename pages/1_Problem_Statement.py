    This project aims to predict adverse events following the administration of mRNA-based 
    COVID-19 vaccines through supervised classification models. Utilizing anonymized 
    patient survey datasets, the goal is to develop risk models that predict the 
    likelihood of vaccine side effects using demographic, health, and prior reaction data as features.

    """
    - **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** A significant task is to handle missing or imbalanced data entries, which is common in real-world datasets.
    
    - **Model Implementation:** Implement classifiers such as logistic regression, **random forests**, or **gradient boosting**, focusing on producing calibrated probability outputs to aid in risk assessment.
    
    - **Model Evaluation:** The model's clinical utility is evaluated using tools like **confusion matrices** and **precision-recall curves**.
    
    - **Ethical Considerations:** The project requires careful and ethical handling of sensitive health data.

    The key outcome is to produce **transparent predictors with actionable interpretations** that can be valuable for public health frameworks. The model should not only be predictive 
    but also explainable.
